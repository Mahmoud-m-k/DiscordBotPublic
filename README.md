"# Discord-bot"

This was a personal development project I undertook during the summer period, focusing on creating an interactive Discord bot. The bot was designed to enhance server engagement by responding to user commands and prompts in real-time.

Key features included:

Command-based interaction system allowing users to trigger specific bot responses
Real-time message processing and automated responses
Custom prefix commands for easy bot interaction
User-friendly interface and intuitive command structure
Virtual currency system that allowed users to trade and earn a virtual coin

The project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

Discord.js library and Discord API integration
Bot deployment and hosting
Event handling and asynchronous programming
Basic server management and maintenance

This project served as a practical application of programming concepts while creating a useful tool for Discord community engagement. The bot remained active in several servers, providing automated assistance and entertainment features for users.
